About Us
========

This is an organization centered around the Math and Computer Science department at Adelphi University. All faculty, students, and alumni are welcome to join. The purpose of this organization is to give students and faculty a place to share interesting techniques, tutorials, and problems with others. Feel free to create repos and to contribute to existing ones. Also, you are more than welcome to invite other students. 

Enjoy!
