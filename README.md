All faculty, students, and alumni of Adelphi University are welcome to join. To do so, you just need someone in the organization to invite you. If you don't know anyone, send an email to [Branden Stone](mailto:bstone@adelphi.edu) asking for an invite. 

Team Structure
===

Our organization is composed of three main teams: Owners, Students, Alumni. All students and alumni are giving administration privileges. For more information see the [GitHub permission levels](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization-repository/) page. 

When you join, you will only be able to see the teams you are a part of. In particular, if you are a member of the student team, you will not be able to see the repositories available from the Alumni team until you graduate and are then added to the team. 

New Repositories
===

This organization is for people to experiment and get feed back from the Adelphi community. So please, feel free to create repos and to contribute to existing ones. 

Running Themes
===

Throughout the course of time there will be a few running themes of repositories. We will try to keep an up to date list available here.
